### Define the code
With this code we can print errors. As we know whenever we write ruby in HTML with mote you
must place a sign `%` before writing the code:  

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rociopaez/ad8383d8cc3c8f793246.js"></script>

**Line 1**  
First we are defined the `session` with a hash `params` and this params with a hash `session`.  

**Line 3 to 7:**  
If session has a hash with the key: `success` it will print the value.
To print in mote you need to use double `{}` `session.delete(:success)`  
Do the same for the session error (Line 9 to 13)

### Define my layout

### Write the message
Now to work, we need to write the message that you want to print.  
We are execute the code on `line 13` and `line 29`.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rociopaez/dea06fc5d84418a75bed.js"></script>

Here we are execute the code in the line 14
