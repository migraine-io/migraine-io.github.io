When you want to test the application you are building, there is a great technique that solves these cases.
With this technique you can do the tests you want without having to put the information on your application
by hand.

To use it you must do the following:

You need to create a file with the name `makefile` with the following content:

{% highlight ruby %}
seed:
	ruby seeds.rb
{% endhighlight ruby %}

It is important to use a `<tab>` to indent the commands and not spaces.

If we go to the code:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rociopaez/7132603499481e77382a.js"></script>

## What I'm doing here?

**Line 1**  
Why do you write `require_relative` and no only `require`?  
You are saying that you aren't requiring a gem, but a file that is in the same folder.

**Line 3**  
Here I'm using a Redis command [FLUSHDB](http://redis.io/commands/flushdb). This command deletes all
the data. In my case it deletes all the users and types.

**Line 5**  
I am assigning a variable `user` and I am saying the following:
Create an instance of the User class with the following parameters (name, email and password).
Those parameters will be the `user` attributes.

**Line 7**  
I'm doing the same thing for the rest.
Create an instance of the Type class with the following parameters (category and name).

That's how I create a user and a types for my testing.
