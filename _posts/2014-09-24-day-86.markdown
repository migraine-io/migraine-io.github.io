Line 7 to 8:  
When in the route appears the id, must run the id parameter (we are defining which type is equal to the Type class with the parameter id.)  

Line 10:  
When you do post to the param `type` you do the following:
update your type with the atributtes category and name (this attributes are define in the model type)
Then redirect to the principal page: types.
If you don't press send, you stay in the page: types/edit.  

Line 20:  
On post param type do the following params:
Create a type with the attributes category and name and the user id is always present.
Then redirect to the principal pages but if you dont send the value you stay in the same page.

Here I define the form action, I'm writing on the path the user id.

![create_edit_types3](/images/create_edit_types3.jpg)

Now my Types already can edit and create
