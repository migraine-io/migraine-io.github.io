Now the app is working better.
I can create and edit types by user.

Before you could not see the changes made.

[See the commit][1]

Line 7 to 8:  
Matches a `id` parameter.

Line 10:  
When you do post to the param `type` you do the following:

Update your type with the attributes category and name (this attributes are defined in the model type)
Then redirect to the principal page: types.

Line 20:  
When a types param is present on post:
Create a type with the attributes category and name and the user id is always present.
Then redirect to the main page.

![create_edit_types1](/images/create_edit_types1.jpg)

Here I define the form action, I'm specifying the user id on the path.

![create_edit_types2](/images/create_edit_types2.jpg)

![create_edit_types3](/images/create_edit_types3.jpg)

Now I can edit and create Types.
