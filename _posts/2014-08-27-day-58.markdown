To edit, I need to use [scrivener][1] again, we need to validate that the new user log data are correct.  
Scrivener helps to validate parameters that you want to assign.
Is the same like in the Sign Up and Sign In.

[1]: https://github.com/soveran/scrivener

I create a file with the name: `update_profile.rb`

Here we are validate 3 attributes:  
- name  
- email  
- current_email  

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rociopaez/d900c0d6ff32c2755df0.js"></script>

I wrote in the form: `edit_profile` and I verify the name and the email.
This is the same validation like the form Sign Up and Sign In.
Line 3 to 18.  

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rociopaez/0a7c2057ec4d96e11d74.js"></script>

Define the route.  
I define `update_profile` in the line 5.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rociopaez/fb42a0d585339578989e.js"></script>

Now in the app you can edit the profile :)

To edit the password I create a new class with the validation.
Will be able to see in the next block.
