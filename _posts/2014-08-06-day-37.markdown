#### Start the server with   `make server`

To run the server from the terminal without having to write `rackup` all the time, you just need to open a file in your text editor with the name `makefile`
With the following content:

{% highlight ruby %}
server:
	shotgun -o 0.0.0.0
{% endhighlight ruby %}

It is important to use a `<tab>` to indent the commands and not spaces.

You need to download the gem <a href="https://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun">shotgun</a>.

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install shotgun
{% endhighlight bash %}

Then you can run

{% highlight bash %}
$ make server
{% endhighlight bash %}

This is what you get in response:

{% highlight bash %}
shotgun -o 0.0.0.0
== Shotgun/WEBrick on http://0.0.0.0:9393/
[2014-08-09 20:40:18] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
[2014-08-09 20:40:18] INFO  ruby 2.1.2 (2014-05-08) [x86_64-darwin13.0]
[2014-08-09 20:40:18] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=23274 port=9393
{% endhighlight bash %}

Now you no longer have to manually restart your server all the time.
