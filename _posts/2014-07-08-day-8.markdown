For now I should not worry about the styles, so I'll see this later.  

I decided to do my project with <a href ="https://atom.io">Atom</a>, before I was working with <a href ="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>, but it has convinced me.
Personally, I like the 'Atom' interface better, the preference setting are very dynamic.  

I love it!

They look like this:

Seen how the font size is changed so easy in Atom?  
Now I have to find shortcuts to make it easier to write my code.
