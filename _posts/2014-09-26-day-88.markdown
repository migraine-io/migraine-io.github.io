My application is almost ready, now what we do is erase any record.

For example in my `types` I do (To delete is important to use `POST` instead of `GET`):  

{% highlight ruby %}
on "delete", post do
  type.delete

  res.redirect("/types")
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}

In my index page:

On the route the id must be present.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rociopaez/3416a0ca42af3de1717e.js"></script>.

So, I do the same with the Outputs and Inputs.

[Delete Outputs](https://github.com/migraine-io/migraine-app/commit/f7ded06801a21b5f209c0343871bfff40b1c5703)

[Delete Inputs](https://github.com/migraine-io/migraine-app/commit/23bec20f89d6964fd1f7e3c10fe309e59ef87d46)
