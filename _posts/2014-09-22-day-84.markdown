The code in my select duration is very large, now I learn a form to simplyficate the code:

Para poder simplificar mi selector de duracion y no tener que escribirlo todo el tiempo que lo necesite, he definido una variable DURATION y con el siguiente arreglo de hashes.
Esto lo estoy definiendo en mi modelo Output.

To simplify my selector of `duration` and then not have to write all the large code, I have defined a variable `DURATION`  with the following hashes.
This I am defining in my model `Output`.

For this to work I delete all my options selector and replace it with the following code:

![duration_output](/images/duration_output.jpg)

Here I am saying is that to edit my outputs (line 32 to 38)  
I'm calling to the variable `DURATION` and will run each method (that I need to pass through the entire array).
If the duration of my output is the same as the duration that mark, you should stay at the same length, otherwise it must put the new duration that user dialed.  


To create a new Output use the same code, except that we will remove the condition, since for this case we do not need.
