The code in my select duration is very large, now I learned a way to simplify the code:

To simplify my selector of `duration` and then to not have to write all that I have defined a constant `DURATION` as a hash.

This I am defining it in my model `Output`.

For this to work I delete all my options selector and replace it with the following code:

![duration_output](/images/duration_output.jpg)

What I am saying here is that to edit my outputs (line 32 to 38)  
I'm calling to the constant `DURATION` and will run each method (that I need to pass through the entire array).
If the duration of my output is the same as the duration that of that option, it is shown as selected.  

To create a new Output, we use the same code, except that we will remove the condition, since for this case we do not need it.
