## The smallest Ruby Web App example

Today I learn how  to use the first step of <a href="http://cuba.is">Cuba</a> (Ruby microframework for web development).

To install cuba you need to do the following steps in your terminal:

~~~
$ gem install cuba
~~~

Now you have Cuba install in your terminal    :)

I created a folder with the name:

*migraine-app*

In this folder you need to create a new file called: `README.md`  
If you don't like to use the extension `.md`, you can use: `.markdown` and `.mdown`.

Create another file called `app.rb` with the following code:

{% highlight ruby %}
require "cuba"

Cuba.define do
  on(root) do
    res.write("Hello World!")
  end
end
{% endhighlight ruby %}

Finally to run the application create a file called `config.ru` with the following code:

{% highlight ruby %}
require "./app"

run(Cuba)
{% endhighlight ruby %}

Then you need to run `rackup` which is a command to run `rack` applications, it will use the `config.ru` file.

Now you go to http://localhost:9292 and that's it!
