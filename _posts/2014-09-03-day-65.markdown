We'll have to do the same like in the update profile.

I create a file with the name: `update_password.rb`

Here we are validate 2 attributes:  
- password  
- password_confirmation

##### Then I go to the route: profile:

Then I write the mistakes that I need to print:
We put the same parameters errors that we use in the `Sign Up`. I'm just adding the `password confirmation`.  
(Line 4 to 22).
