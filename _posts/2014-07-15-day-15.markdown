Today I created a new repository with the structure of my web.

<a href ="https://github.com/migraine-io/mock-up">www.github.com/migraine-io/mock-up</a>

I learned to create a new repository from my terminal.  
This is done as follows:

First you need to go to the folder you want to turn into a repository, then, you need to write the following:

{% highlight bash %}  
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:migraine-io/mock-up.git
git push -u origin master
{% endhighlight bash %}

Simple right?

:)
