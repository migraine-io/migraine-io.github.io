I had to make a selector for the date.
I needed a selector for the month, day and year.

Instead of writing 30 times:

{% highlight ruby %}
<label for="date">Date</label>
  <select>
   <option>1</option>
   <option>2</option>
   <option>3</option>
  </select>
</label>  
{% endhighlight ruby %}

I can’t write the code in this template because I’didn’t find the form to write Ruby in a templete with markdown without executing the code. I guess for my next post and I’ll have the way to go, as it is not critical to my application.

#### You can do the following for the month:

To write in Ruby with [mote](https://github.com/soveran/mote) you always need to write `%`.  
Now you write:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rociopaez/707c1a9d7e2ab66a4e35.js"></script>


Here we are giving a method `each`.  
I'm saying:  
You should start at number 1 to 12.  
The default date must be today place: `Time.now.month`.  

#### The same applies for days:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rociopaez/676bed92dc1d1756433a.js"></script>

You should start at number 1 and finish in 12.
The default date must be today place: `Time.now.day`   (I'm change month for day)

#### And the year:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rociopaez/7f59432ab57565d69907.js"></script>

Here what we are saying is:  
The default date must be today place: `Time.now.year`.  
After we are asking me to put in less than two years selector year in which we are.

With this code I can now create forms without having to manually type all options.
