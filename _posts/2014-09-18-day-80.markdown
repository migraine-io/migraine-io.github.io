Today I learn how I can edit my outputs.

I create the template: `outputs/edit`

For this to work is important to locate the select and change the `selected`  
- Month: line 8  
- Day: line 13  
- Year: line 20  
- Scale: line 27  
- Duration: line 32 to 37

For example if you see the template `outputs/new` I replace:  
`Time.now.month => output.date.month`  
You're saying that instead of putting the current date you must put the date that select the user that you want to edit.

Here I define in my index the link of edit output: is important that in the route is present the user id.

Now to work I go to the route: output.rb

Line 7:  
When in the route appears the id, must run the id parameter (we are defining which output is equal to the Output class with the parameter id.)

on post param output ejecute params:
Date =  am creating a date using the parameters: date_month, date_year and date_day  
output = then update the attributes: date, scale and duration.  

Once you update your outputs will redirect you to the initial page of outputs, if you do not send you stay on the page `edit/outputs`.

You do the same with the inputs.
